The following project is for a hair salon / beauty cosmetics company based in Guelph, Ontario. The owner, Jason Cozzarin, asked me to develop a website for his new business
"91 Waterloo Avenue". 

The website is dynamic and can adjust to different screen sizes. 

Coded with HTML / CSS and JavaScript.
